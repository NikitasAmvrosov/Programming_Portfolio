# Flight Management System (C)

A console-based Flight Management System written in C to simulate basic airline operations.  
This project was developed as part of my programming practice and demonstrates the use of **structs, arrays, file handling, and modular code design**.

## Features
- Add, remove, and manage airlines, airports, and flights
- Search for available flights between airports
- Store and retrieve flight data using text files
- Display flight paths and schedules
- Menu-driven interface for user interaction

## Technical Highlights
- Implemented **structs** to represent Airlines, Airports, and FlightPaths
- Used **dynamic arrays and file I/O** for persistent data storage
- Focus on **modular programming** (separated header files and source files)
- Error handling for invalid input and missing data

## Skills Gained
- Strengthened C fundamentals (structs, pointers, file I/O)
- Practiced organizing larger programs into multiple files
- Learned how to design and document a system with multiple components
