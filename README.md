# Programming Portfolio

Welcome to my programming portfolio!  
This repository contains a selection of personal projects and coursework in **C, C++, and C#**, showcasing my learning journey in programming alongside my Aerospace Engineering studies.

## Projects
- [C Coursework](./C-Coursework)  
  Algorithms and exercises covering arrays, structs, memory management, and file handling.
  Small programs focusing on file handling, linked data structures, and simulations (e.g., jukebox, shuttle sorting).   

- [Flight Management System](./Flight-Management-System)  
  A larger project simulating airline operations with structs, modular design, and file I/O.
